Question 4 - 
Megah Holdings Berhad is a diversified holding company in a few industries. Each industry has different best practices and different ERP
implementation methods.
The revenue optimization team requires a dashboard which displays and analyses daily sales at the end of business day from three business
units. Describe a data pipeline with the following input sources:

a. Retail company ERP - Real time API in XML
b. Chicken Broiler/Farm ERP - Hourly batch file generation in FTP server
c. Trading company ERP - Manual Excel files download


Input Sources and Data Acquisition

The data pipeline encompasses three primary input sources:

  1.Retail Company ERP: Real-time sales data is retrieved from the Retail company ERP via an API connector, which establishes a connection and fetches XML data representing     the sales transactions.

  2.Chicken Broiler/Farm ERP: Hourly batch files containing sales data are generated by the Chicken Broiler/Farm ERP and stored on an FTP server. An FTP client is employed      to connect to the server, download the batch files at hourly intervals, and parse them into a structured format.

  3.Trading Company ERP: Sales data is manually exported from the Trading company ERP as Excel files. A script is developed to automate the download of these Excel files,       ensuring consistent data acquisition.

Data Processing and Transformation

Once acquired, the data undergoes a series of processing and transformation steps to ensure consistency and prepare it for analysis:

  1.Data Cleaning: The data is meticulously examined to identify and remove any errors, inconsistencies, or outliers that could compromise the integrity of the analysis.

  2.Data Standardization: Data formats and units are standardized across all three sources to facilitate seamless integration and analysis. This ensures compatibility and      eliminates the need for manual data manipulation.

  3.Data Transformation: The data is transformed into a common format that aligns with the requirements of the analysis. 

Data Aggregation and Analysis

The processed data is then aggregated and analyzed to provide meaningful insights into daily sales performance:

  1.Data Aggregation: Sales data is aggregated at the end of each business day for each business unit, providing a consolidated view of daily sales performance.

  2.Sales Analysis: Aggregated sales data is analyzed to calculate key metrics such as average sales, sales growth, and market share trends. These metrics provide valuable      insights into the performance of each business unit and identify areas for improvement.

Data Storage and Visualization

The processed and analyzed data is stored in a central data repository, ensuring its accessibility and preservation for future analysis. Additionally, a comprehensive dashboard is developed to visualize the data in an insightful and actionable manner:

  1.Data Storage: The aggregated and analyzed data is stored in a secure and centralized data warehouse or data lake. This facilitates data governance, maintains data          integrity, and ensures easy access for authorized users.

  2.Data Visualization: An interactive dashboard is designed to present daily sales data for each business unit in a clear and concise manner. Charts, graphs, and other        visualizations are employed to effectively communicate key trends and patterns.

  3.User Interaction: The dashboard provides interactive features that enable users to filter and drill down into the data, allowing them to explore specific aspects of        interest and uncover deeper insights.

Data Pipeline

The data pipeline is orchestrated and monitored to ensure its smooth operation and timely delivery of insights

The data pipeline for Megah Holdings Berhad effectively integrates sales data from three diverse business units, transforming it into a unified format for analysis. By combining data acquisition, processing, aggregation, storage, and visualization, the pipeline provides actionable insights that empower the revenue optimization team to make informed decisions and drive business growth.
